## Why Namira Exists ?

In a time of internet surveillance and increasing incursions on individual freedoms, we remain committed to the ideals of the unobstructed flow of information principles.

This belief is what created Namira  (a name that means “*pure*” and symbolizes resilience, continuity, and **freedom**).

### Namira: Always Connected. Always Free.

Namira is not just a name—it's our promise. Where access is often denied, delayed, or censored, we design products to keep people connected no matter what. Whether you're living under dictatorship or get regular internet shutdowns (like Iran do.) , Namira provides you with fast, secure, and censorship-free connectivity solutions (Survivalism) .

### Anti-Censorship & GFW-Bypassing

We stand in opposition to all censorship and discrimination. Our products are designed to bypass and overcome blockages, offering users tools to get around firewalls (GFW), DPI, and blacklists.

### Join Us

If you share our mission, if you believe in open access to information, and the uncontainable human right to connect, then join us.
